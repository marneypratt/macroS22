## Getting Setup

Before getting started, it is a good practice to start with a clean slate by restarting your R session

Go to the top menu, select Session then select Restart R

Keep all of your analysis in this same .Rmd file and keep all the associated files in the project folder. Make sure the project name is showing in the upper right of the RStudio window.

# Load packages

```{r setup}

library(tidyverse) ## for readr, dplyr, ggplot
library(vegan) ## for calculating diversity measures (you can remove this if you are not calculating diversity measures)
library(ggbeeswarm) ## for jittering points

```

# Import Data

Figure out which data file(s) you need to import. Find the code you need in the "importing_data" folder within the "script_templates" folder. Copy and paste the code you need in the chunk below.

```{r import data}


```

# Data Wrangling

Find the code you need to prepare or "wrangle" your data to make any calculations needed and combine any datasets you need to combine by looking in the "data_wrangling" folder within the "script_templates" folder. Copy and paste the code you need in the chunk below.

```{r data wrangling}



```

# Data Description

Find the code you need to describe your data by looking in the "descriptive_stats" folder within the "script_templates" folder. Copy and paste the code you need in the chunk below.

```{r descriptive stats}



```

# Data Visualization

Find the code you need to visualize (=graph) your data by looking in the "graphing" folder within the "script_templates" folder. Copy and paste the code you need in the chunk below.

```{r graphs}



```

To save your graph with the `ggsave()` function, you need to name the resulting file with surrounding " ", and indicate the size via height, width, and units. Don't forget to save the graph with a dpi call between 300-500 to make it nice and crisp! Look at the `ggsave()` help file for more information and options.

```{r Save your graph, eval = F}

# save the graph!
ggsave(filename="___.png",  #recommended to use.png or .jpg file types
       height = 7, width = 8, units = "in", 
       dpi = 300)

```

Don't forget to "knit" your .Rmd file when you are done. Make sure that each code chunk has an unique name or no name before you knit. Make sure all your files are in the project folder.

Knit straight to PDF or knit to HTML, open the HTML file in your browser, and then "print" to a PDF file.

Insert a file printout of the PDF in the "Project Data Analysis" section of your Lab Notebook.
