season: the sampling season 

  Summer is Apr 15 - Jun 15
  Fall is Aug 15 - Oct 15




total.precip: total precipitation in millimeters over a 60 day period
	This value was calculated as the total amount of daily precipitation in mm for the 60 days prior to and including sampling of macroinvertebrates


	Daily precipitation in milimeters was downloaded from the 
	National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) 
	https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/land-based-station-data/land-based-datasets/global-historical-climatology-network-ghcn
      
      NOAA GHCN weather data were downloaded for Amherst, MA station (ID = USC00190120) with the rnoaa package in R and the meteo_tidy_ghcnd() function           
      Chamberlain, S (2021). rnoaa: 'NOAA' weather data from R. R package version 1.3.2.     
          https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rnoaa)

ADD: aggregated degree days (ADD) for the 60 days prior to sampling and including sampling of macroinvertebrates
       

      Daily minimum (Tmin) and maximum (Tmax) temperatures in Celcius were downloaded from the 
	National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) 
	https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/land-based-station-data/land-based-datasets/global-historical-climatology-network-ghcn
      
      NOAA GHCN weather data were downloaded for Amherst, MA station (ID = USC00190120) with the rnoaa package in R and the meteo_tidy_ghcnd() function

          https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rnoaa)
          
      To calculate ADD, the Tmin and Tmax were averaged to give an estimate of average daily temperature (Tavg).  
	Then the Tavg was summed for 60 days prior to and including the sampling date
